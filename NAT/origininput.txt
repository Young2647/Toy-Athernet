Caught in a never ending game seems like the world's still trying to tame me
If that's the way I will obey beautifully struggle every day
Shouldn't we have a little kiss
While seeing both of our hourglasses
Let's make a plan and meet somewhere that is the most far from goodbye
Finally the time has come everything up to yesterday was a prologue
Just skimmin' through the days of old it's my turn to bear the load
My experience and my skill and all the courage I had left started to mildew
At an unprecedented speed I will dive right into you
And when I go and stomp into a lukewarm can of soda
I dreamed of a world so far from here that's not on the map
Searching outside of the classroom window
Or in a summer morning that's brought open by a commuting train
Words like tomorrow or future or fate
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe we dream we raise our love
In a timeless land that is far out of reach
Even the second hour hands of the clock
They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
How I hope to have forever to spend this life no
All future lives
Right here in this world with you
Let's put 'em away then bow our heads
How do you do's and all the nice to meet you's
And breathe over a thousand years cycled in a single day
Oh how I hated life in this world
It's made up entirely of fiction every word stacked
I saw through my kaleidoscope on a monotonous august morn'
When you appeared in front of me you acted shy
But I didn't miss your grinning face
It's like it fits the textbook of this world
Of how to make your smilin' face
